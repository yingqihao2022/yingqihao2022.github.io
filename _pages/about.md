<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a third-year undergraduate student from [Weixian College](https://www.wxc.tsinghua.edu.cn) and [School of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My research interest includes AI for Neuroscience, Medical Image Analysis.

I am very fortunate to work as a research assistant at [Birth Lab](https://birthlab.github.io/) led by [Prof. Qiyuan Tian](https://www.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1143/2126.htm) from School of Biomedical Engineering, Tsinghua University. 

I am mentored by PhD student [Mingxuan Liu](http://arktis2022.github.io) at Birth Lab.
